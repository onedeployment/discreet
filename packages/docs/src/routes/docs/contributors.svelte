	<h2>Contributors</h2>
	<p>
		To become a contributor you should note that our working hours are informal: 4-5 hours per week
		except for remote meetings.
	</p>
	<p>
		We have no requirements for new contributors, we regularly ensure that their skills/talents are
		appropriate for the role to be highlighted.
	</p>
	<p>
		We are a bilingual team in Spanish and English where we unify the planning in English into a
		single path.

	<p>The contributor process looks like this:</p>
